# 739. Daily Temperatures

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `i-th` day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- Input: `temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]`
- Output: `[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]`

### Example 2:
- Input: `temperatures = [30,40,50,60]`
- Output: `[1,1,1,0]`

### Example 3:
- Input: `temperatures = [30,60,90]`
- Output: `[1,1,0]`

## Constraints:
- `1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5`
- `30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100`

## Solution Approach
A monotonic decreasing stack is used to keep track of the temperatures for which we haven't found a warmer day yet.
1. Iterate through the temperatures.
2. For each temperature, while it's greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack:
   - Pop the index from the stack.
   - Calculate the difference between the current index and the popped index.
   - Store this difference in the result array at the popped index.
3. Push the current index onto the stack.
