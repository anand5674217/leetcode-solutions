# 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

## Problem Description
You are given the `head` of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the `head` of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋th` node from the start using 0-based indexing, where `⌊x⌋` denotes the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.

- For `n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5`, the middle nodes are `0, 1, 1, 2, and 2`, respectively.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- Input: `head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]`
- Output: `[1,3,4,1,2,6]`
- Explanation: `n = 7`, middle node is index 3 (value 7).

### Example 2:
- Input: `head = [1,2,3,4]`
- Output: `[1,2,4]`
- Explanation: `n = 4`, middle node is index 2 (value 3).

### Example 3:
- Input: `head = [2,1]`
- Output: `[2]`
- Explanation: `n = 2`, middle node is index 1 (value 1).

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
